# AC Rms Current Scale Factor: 1.000000
# Layout Scale Factor: 1.000000
#    Width = drawn_width
#    CutArea = drawn_area
#    FixWidth = fix_width
# NOTE:Fix width/via num. obtained based on current from original design
# The EM limit is based on the drawn_width * layout_scale and drawn_area * layout_scale ^ 2.
# The current or EM limit or CutArea at via layer is reported as the sum value of all cuts for a via cluster
# UNITS: 
#    Frequency in Gigahertz
#    Rise,Fall Times in Nanoseconds, and 0-100% full time transition
#    Td in Nanoseconds
#    Capacitance in Picofarads
#    Width, Length in Micrometers
#    Current (Irms,Limit) in milliAmps
# Markers:
#    * : violations of ratio >= 1.0, when em_threshold < 1.0; violations of ratio >= em_threshold, when em_threshold >= 1.0.
#    + : violations of em_threshold <= ratio < 1.0, when em_threshold < 1.0.
#    - : violations of 1.0 <= ratio < em_threshold, when em_threshold > 1.0.
# Eff Freq:
#    When the column has x.xxx (y.yyy), it means that tool gets y.yyy frequency from the design, but x.xxx frequency is applied to calculate EM, where x.xxx could be set by the freq of -default_freq_for_unconstrained_nets or -minPeakFreq.
# Type: Clk*
# * indicates that net is a crossing between data and clock nets where Eff Freq and Clock Freq come from data while Type is marked as Clk
# Mode*:
# * indicates slewing from ideal ramp voltage source due to no timing arc
# Mode: [regular|simulation|spice] indicates the net is analyzed by regular, simulation or spice flow respectively.
